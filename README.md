# Solving Mountain Car problem with semi-gradient sarsa
This notebook provides a simple implementation solving the mountain car challenge from the openAI gym using the semi-gradient sarsa algorithm as described in (Sutton, R.S. and Barto, A.G., 2018. Reinforcement learning: An introduction. MIT Press).

To deal with the continuous states a coarse coding function is implemented. 

Though it solves the challenge, this implementation is surely not the optimal implementation, I cannot even guarantee that it is a correct implementation of the algorithms. But I could not find any implementation online (apart from using tensorflow) so I want to provide my work to other people studying this topic.
